# Epoch Light Theme

**Epoch** is a minimalist, high-clarity browser theme suite designed for engineers who value focus. 

Designed to reduce visual latency and cognitive load by removing decorative noise and utilizing a low-saturation, high-contrast palette.

## The Engineering
Unlike standard themes, Epoch is treated as a software artifact:
- **Reproducible:** Managed via `uv` and Python.
- **Procedural:** Assets are generated via code, not manual editing.
- **Automated:** CI/CD pipelines handle packaging.

## Installation
1. Download the latest `.zip` from Releases.
2. Go to `about:debugging` in Firefox.
3. Click "This Firefox" > "Load Temporary Add-on".
4. Select `manifest.json`.
